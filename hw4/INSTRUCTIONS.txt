Students:
=========================================

For this homework, you have to debug a faulty program and
fix its use of dynamic memory.

Rather than give answers in a text file, you must use Git to
save versions of the code and DOCUMENT YOUR FIXES in the Git log text.

There are 2 phases for this assignment, but only 1 submission.

0. Use Git and commit the code as soon as you get it to create a baseline.

1. Debug the sources to make the program stop crashing.

	The program crashes from the start. Fix enough of the
	problems to make it run without crashing.

	Document fixes in the Git commit text to wrap up this phase.
	The commit message must identify the errors fixed and the
	function(s) in which those errors were found.

2. Use valgrind to fix the memory leaks.

	To wrap this phase up, document the fixes in the Git commit text.
	The commit message must identify the errors fixed and found.
	The commit message should describe why those errors occurred.

Then save the Git log to revisions.txt and submit that file with the
source files that changed.
